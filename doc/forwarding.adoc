[#forwarding]
== Forwarding request

In some environment, you may need to access your stub always from a
particular path, like `/api/your-api-name` and your library may not
allow you to change the prefix `/api`. To resolve this issue, there
are configuration options called `forwardingPath` and `forwardingResolvers`
on `OasStubOptions`.

Example usage:
[source, java]
----
public class Example() {
    var options = OasStubOptions.builder()
            .stubOptions()
            .forwardingPath("/")
            .addForwardingResolver(new OasStubApiByHeaderForwardingResolver("X-OAS-Stub-Application"))
            .parent()
            .build();
    var server = OasStubServer(options);
    server.start();
}
----

Then support you have `pestore` APIs uploaded, now you can request the
API like the below command:

[source, shell]
----
curl -H'X-OAS-Stub-Application: petstore' http://localhost:8080/v1/pets/1
----

For this example, the server resolves the API context from the header value.

To create a custom resolver, you need to implement `OasStubApiForwardingResolver`
interface and pass it to the configuration.

For the API documentation, see Javadoc of the interface.
