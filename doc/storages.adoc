[#storages]
== Other storages

OAS stub supports multiple storage implementations, currently
we support the followings:

- In-memory
- Hazelcast
- MongoDB

All the storages are located in separate modules.

=== For Spring Boot users

If you are using `oas-stub-starter-web` module, then `in-memory`
storage is used by default. The belows are the auto-configuration
modules of the other storages:

For Hazelcast storage:
