[#metrics]
== API metrics

In some cases, it's convenient to have some metrics for the
registered API. For example, you may want to validate the
number of incoming requests, and/or how many of them responded
successfully.

| Endpoint                                      | Query Parameter

| GET /__admin/metrics/\{context}               | N/A
|===

The endpoint returns a JSON object of API path as its key and
metrics as its value.

The metrics recording can be suppressed if the `shouldMonitor`
option is set and its value is `true`.
